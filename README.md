# IBM Client Engineering Solutions Hub Template TEST

## What is this?

This is a template used to quickly and effectively document assets and solutions created by Client Engineers at IBM. The template outlines the bare minimum requirements that must be documented when publishing your work. This template was created using the `gatsby-theme-carbon` package, [click here](https://gatsby-theme-carbon.vercel.app/) to learn more.

## How do I use it?

1. Use this template to create a new repository in the ibm-client-engineering Open Solutions Library.

    Make sure you follow the naming convention: solution-[insert solution name].

2. Clone your new repository to your local machine.

3. Start developing by running the site locally.

    Navigate into your directory with `cd solution-<solution name>`.

    Install the Gatsby CLI with `brew install gatsby-cli` or `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

    Run `yarn install` to get everything set up.
    
    Run the site locally with `yarn dev`.

4. Make changes and begin documenting your solution.

    Start by adding your solution name in you `gatsby-config.js` file at the root of your project. Replace all instances of [insert solution name] with your solution's name and it will update across the site.

    You can now go to the pages folder and fill out the .mdx files with the required documentaiton for your solution. [Click here](https://gatsby-theme-carbon.vercel.app/components/Accordion) to see the various components you can use in the .mdx files.
